      <h3>Professional Journey:</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm a dedicated web developer and passionate programmer who thrives on turning digital dreams into reality. My journey in the tech realm became professional after completing the Web Development Bootcamp at California Polytechnic State University. Since then, I've engaged in a mix of freelance web development, volunteer website administration, and bespoke project development using the powerful PERN stack.

      <h3>What Drives Me:</h3>
      <p>
        My goal is to be of service, using my skills to help others achieve their digital dreams. My passion is programming, a craft that I continually refine and enjoy. Mentoring holds a special place in my heart, as I find immense joy in contributing to the growth of others. Service is not just a professional pursuit for me; it's a profoundly enriching aspect of my life. I am fueled by the satisfaction of unraveling intricate, challenging problems and am resolute in my commitment to never stop learning and growing, both personally and professionally.

      <h3>Life Outside of Tech:</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the screen and code, you'll find me pushing physical boundaries through weightlifting or diving into captivating stories, whether through web novels, audiobooks, anime, or video games. Connecting with friends is equally important, as I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle that fuels creativity and innovation.
      </p>
