        Beyond the screen and code, you'll find me pushing physical boundaries through weightlifting or diving into captivating stories, be it through webnovels, audiobooks, anime, or video games. Connecting with friends is equally important, as I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle that fuels creativity and innovation.
